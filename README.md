1. Introduction
The project explores the impact of e-commerce on consumer shopping habits and focuses on the challenges businesses face in managing delivery systems to meet client expectations. The goal is to optimize e-commerce delivery systems for improved customer satisfaction and retention.

2. Literature Review
A comprehensive review of literature highlights the importance of customer retention in e-commerce, focusing on factors like service quality, perceived value, and the role of fuzzy logic in sentiment analysis. Key references include works by Hayes (2018), Tamuliene and Gabryte (2014), and Zadeh (1997).

3. System Model and Code Functionality
3.1 System Model
The project models the operation of an e-commerce delivery system using Python. The simulation aims to enhance delivery efficiency and customer satisfaction.

3.2 Working of Code
3.2.1 Code
The project's code is available in the file "project_code.py" in the submission folder.

3.2.2 Function Calls
Key functions include:

- num_of_customers(): Generates new customer numbers.
- generate_rating_data(): Creates random customer ratings.
- generate_delivery_data(): Generates random delivery times.
- generate_order_value(): Produces random order values.
- retention_compute(): Computes retention rates using fuzzy logic.
- main_loop(): Integrates all functions for data generation and retention rate calculation.

3.2.3 Code Flow
The code processes customer data, applies the retention algorithm, and calculates customer numbers for subsequent periods.

4. Retention Factor
The project examines how delivery experiences influence customer retention. It uses fuzzy logic to categorize customer feedback and compute retention rates.

5. Simulation & Analysis
The simulation assesses how retention rates and order values change over time, indicating the health and profitability of the e-commerce platform.

6. Improvement Scheme
Strategies for improvement include analyzing customer feedback, offering incentives, and maintaining effective customer relations.

7. Conclusion
